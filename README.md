# Repo for implementing Whisper model for Lives project 

Python code for implementing the [Whisper model](https://github.com/openai/whisper) to transcribe English and Spanish interviews and to translate Spanish interviews to English translation. 

## Setup 
You will need to set up an appropriate coding environment:

* [Python (version 3.7 or higher)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org)
* The following command will pull and install the latest commit from openai/whipser repository.
```
pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git
```
* It also required the command-line tool ```ffmpeg``` to be installed on your system, which is available from most package managers:
```
# on Ubuntu or Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg

# on Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S ffmpeg

# on MacOS using Homebrew (https://brew.sh/)
brew install ffmpeg

# on Windows using Chocolatey (https://chocolatey.org/)
choco install ffmpeg

# on Windows using Scoop (https://scoop.sh/)
scoop install ffmpeg
```
* You may need ```rust``` installed as well, in case [tokenizers](https://pypi.org/project/tokenizers/) does not provide a pre-built wheel for your platform. 
```
pip install setuptools-rust
```
## Models and languages
Whisper provides five model sizes, we use the ```base``` model here which is a multilingual model and has 71,825,920 parameters. If you want to implement different sizes of models and consider the approximate memory requirements and relative speed, please go to the ```Available models and languages``` section [here](https://github.com/openai/whisper#readme).

In this project, we use this Whisper model to transcribe and translate English and Spanish audio. It also can transcribe and translate other kinds of languages. All available languages are listed in the [tokenizer.py](https://github.com/openai/whisper/blob/main/whisper/tokenizer.py)

## Python usage
To transcribe and translate the audio, we will use the following function to get the result. 

From [audio.py](https://github.com/openai/whisper/blob/main/whisper/audio.py):

* The ```load_audio()``` method reads the audio file and returns a NumPy array containing the audio waveform, in float32 dtype. 
```
[-0.00018311 -0.00024414 -0.00030518 ... -0.00146484 -0.00195312
 -0.00210571]
```

* The ```pad_or_trim()``` method pads or trims the audio array to N_SAMPLES () to fit 30 seconds.
```
SAMPLE_RATE = 16000
CHUNK_LENGTH = 30 
N_SAMPLES = CHUNK_LENGTH * SAMPLE_RATE # 480000: number of samples in a chunk
```

* The ```log_mel_spectrogram()``` method computes the log-Mel spectrogram of a NumPy array containing the audio waveform and retunes a Tensor that contains the Mel spectrogram and the shape of the Tensor will be (80, 3000). 
```
tensor([[-0.5296, -0.5296, -0.5296,  ...,  0.0462,  0.2417,  0.1118],
        [-0.5296, -0.5296, -0.5296,  ...,  0.0443,  0.1246, -0.1071],
        [-0.5296, -0.5296, -0.5296,  ...,  0.2268,  0.0590, -0.2129],
        ...,
        [-0.5296, -0.5296, -0.5296,  ..., -0.5296, -0.5296, -0.5296],
        [-0.5296, -0.5296, -0.5296,  ..., -0.5296, -0.5296, -0.5296],
        [-0.5296, -0.5296, -0.5296,  ..., -0.5296, -0.5296, -0.5296]])

```

From [decoding.py](https://github.com/openai/whisper/blob/main/whisper/decoding.py):

* The ```detect_language()``` method detects the language of the log-Mel spectrogram and returns a Tensor (_) and the probability distribution (probs) which contains the languages and the probability of each language will be. 

```
_, probs = model.detect_language()
print(f"Detected language: {max(probs, key = probs.get)}")

#probs:
{'en': 0.9958220720291138, 'zh': 7.025230297585949e-05, 'de': 0.00015919747238513082, 'es': 0.0003416460531298071, 'ru': 0.00030879987752996385, 'ko': 0.00028310518246144056, 'fr': 0.00021966002532280982,...}

```

From [transcribe.py](https://github.com/openai/whisper/blob/main/whisper/transcribe.py):

* The ```transcribe()``` method transcribes the audio file and returns a dictionary containing the resulting ```text ("text")``` and ```segment-level details ("segment")```, and the spoken language or the language you want to translate ("language"'). The parameters we put in this method will be the audio file, language, and fp16=False/True. In ```"segment"```, it shows each segment's start and end. With this information, we then can get the time each audio file transcribe (or translate) takes. 

** When the model is running on the ```CPU``` and you set ```fp16=True```, you will get the warning message "FP16 is not supported on CPU; using FP32 instead". Then you should set the ```fp16=False``` to solve the warning. 

```
model.transcribe(audio file, language="english", fp16=False)

I think my calls have been going past what they should be.", 'segments': [{'id': 0, 'seek': 0, 'start': 0.0, 'end': 2.88, 'text': " It's now a good time for a call.
