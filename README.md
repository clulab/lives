# Computational rescue of untapped behavioral data from the LIvES study

Python code for the analysis and creation of machine-learned models for the NIH-funded project "Using natural language processing to determine predictors of a healthy diet and physical activity behavior change in ovarian cancer survivors." https://reporter.nih.gov/search/qfhaBJoM20qq64VSqwCScg/project-details/10109452


## About

In most behavioral interventions, the focus is primarily on whether the intervention improves the medical outcome of interest. As a result, study procedures generate enormous amounts of data during the operationalization of the intervention used only for study management, not for analysis. This data, which we call "secondary process-related data," is often recorded and archived but used only to achieve the main goals of the intervention, not for analysis. We rescue this data through machine learning, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence. We leverage these data to help automate fidelity monitoring and identify low-level, non-traditional predictors of lifestyle behavioral outcomes.
